# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

** NOTES 10/25 ** 

[ ] Context API - currently your cartItems is an object - it is much easier to work with an array (we started changing this today)

[ ] When debugging, it's helpful to comment out parts of the code that you think may be causing that bug. This will help you rule out where a bug is.
